# Harry-Potter-Invisibility-Cloak
<p>This project is based on working with computer vision. I have used OpenCV library in python to deal with the images</p>

#### Requirements:
1. Python 3.0 and above, and
2. OpenCV library

#### Steps to execute the project:
1. [Background.py](https://github.com/AnanyaNagar/Harry-Potter-Invisibility-Cloak/blob/main/Background.py) is used to click a background image, when the object is initially not placed.
2. [invisible_cloak.py](https://github.com/AnanyaNagar/Harry-Potter-Invisibility-Cloak/blob/main/invisible_cloak.py) is used to depict the effect of invisibility by replacing pixels of green color with that of background image.

### Background image:

### Result:
